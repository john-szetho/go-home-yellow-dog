            <p class="text-small"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Chinese_sentiment" class="caps reg">Sinophobia</a> <span class="text-tiny">(from Late Latin Sinae "China" and Greek Ï†ÏŒÎ²Î¿Ï‚, phobos, "fear")</span> is a sentiment against China, its people, overseas Chinese, or Chinese culture. It often targets Chinese minorities living outside of China and involves immigration, development of national identity in neighbouring countries, disparity of wealth, the past central tributary system, majority-minority relations, imperialist legacies, and racism. Its opposite is Sinophilia.</p>
