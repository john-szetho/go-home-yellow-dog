Also, a fear of goods made (or labelled as made) in China. It often targets Chinese minorities living outside of China and involves immigration, development of national identity in neighbouring countries, disparity of wealth, the past central tributary system, majority-minority relations, imperialist legacies, and racism. The opposite of Sinophobia is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinophile" class="ital">Sinophilia</a>.</p>
